_Ready to use “Acknowledgements”/“Licenses”/“Credits” view controller for [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/)._

## How to Install

This project is only useful if you use CocoaPods, so let’s assume that you’re indeed using CocoaPods.

1. Add `pod 'VTAcknowledgementsViewController'` in your `Podfile`.
2. Run `pod install`.
3. Add the `Pods-{target}-acknowledgements.plist` file generated by CocoaPods in `Pods/Target Support Files/Pods-{target}/` to your main target (drag and drop the file in your Xcode project). Don’t copy the file, leave `Copy items if needed` unchecked.


## How to Use

The `VTAcknowledgementsViewController` instance is usually pushed to an existing `UINavigationController`.

``` objc
VTAcknowledgementsViewController *viewController = [VTAcknowledgementsViewController acknowledgementsViewController];
viewController.headerText = NSLocalizedString(@"We love open source software.", nil); // optional
[self.navigationController pushViewController:viewController animated:YES];
```


## Customization

By default, the controller will try to guess the name of your `.plist` file, based on the bundle name (`Pods-#BUNDLE-NAME#-acknowledgements.plist`. If that doesn’t match the file you’re looking for, you can initialize the view controller with a custom file name or path.

``` objc
viewController = [[VTAcknowledgementsViewController alloc] initWithFileNamed:@"Pods-MyTarget-acknowledgements"];
```

``` objc
NSString *path = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"Pods-MyTarget-acknowledgements" ofType:@"plist"];
viewController = [[VTAcknowledgementsViewController alloc] initWithPath:path];
```

The controller can also display a header and a footer. By default, they are loaded from the generated `plist` file, but you can also directly change the properties values.

``` objc
viewController.headerText = NSLocalizedString(@"We love open source software.", nil);
viewController.footerText = NSLocalizedString(@"Powered by CocoaPods.org", nil);
```

If you need to include licenses that are not part of the generated `plist`, or if you don’t want to use the generated `plist` at all, you can easily create new `VTAcknowledgement` instances, and add them to the acknowledgements array of the controller.

``` objc
VTAcknowledgement *customLicense = [[VTAcknowledgement alloc] initWithTitle:NSLocalizedString(@"...", nil) text:NSLocalizedString(@"...", nil) license:nil];

viewController.acknowledgements = @[customLicense];
```

The controller title is a localized value for “acknowledgements” (12 languages supported!). You might want to use this localized value for the button presenting the controller, for instance.

``` objc
[button setTitle:[VTAcknowledgementsViewController localizedTitle]
        forState:UIControlStateNormal];
```

If you need to further customize the appearance or behavior of this pod, feel free to subclass its classes.


## Apple TV

VTAcknowledgementsViewController is also compatible with tvOS for Apple TV apps.
